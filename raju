Hi My name is Rajesh Khanna
My maiden name was Jatin Kapoor
My first movie was railway platform
I am closely related to Jiteendra whose maiden name was Ravi Kapoor
Jitendra was a superstar in the 1970s and 80s.
I remember doing many successful movies with Jitendra
Both of us belong to the golden generation of Indian Cinema
Thanks and Regards
Rajesh Khanna
