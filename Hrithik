Hello Mr Hrithik Roshan
I liked the trailer of your most recent film War
It is an action-packed movie with a lot of twists-and turns
The story is amazing. I like the songs too
How was your first experience working with newbie Tiger Shroff
I believe the guy looks quite promising and feel has a glittering career ahead in bollywood
